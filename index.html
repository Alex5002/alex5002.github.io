        <p>Here is my GitHub website. Have a nice navigation !</p>
        <h2 id="About_me">About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a random french developer who sometimes makes stuff. I code and release someting when I'm inspired.<br>
            I like to find new ways to experiment, test myself at making programs that solve various questions.<br>
            Learned Scratch, HTML, CSS, Python, SQL and C++ at school. And Bash, JS and Lua by myself.<br>
            With all of that, I manage to make websites, Python modules, apps and games.<br>
            I'm really relaxed and slow when coding for myself, but not when it's for professional purposes.
        </p>
